# FIlter-multi-extension-filename
Filter a file name that has made its folder cluttered with many files of that name with different extension name, such as tmp, bak, old, tmp.tmp, bak.bak, etc which usually resulted from several interrupted online update processes.  This utility will tidy up the folder by erasing all except one which is based on the greatest file size, or the newer modification time of two same greatest size if such occurs. The remaining file will have its shortest name, ie. without any extension names specified (or default otherwise)  
User is opt for having its own extension names specification by putting it in second argument preceded by -xt , if skipping it then tmp, bak and old extension names should default
User is opt for having folder level to search for, next in the 3rd  argument preceded with -d. Put -d3,5 for instance, will searh only 3rd through 5th folder depth level relative to current working folder, ie. the 1st folder.
